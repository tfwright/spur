# Spur

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/spur.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/spur)
[![CI status](https://github.com/tfwright/spur/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tfwright/spur/actions)

Loosely based on [chaps-io/public_activity](http://github.com/chaps-io/public_activity), a very simple utility for quickly setting up an activity stream in your Elixir/Ecto app.

More detailed examples of configuration and usage are in the [tests](https://github.com/tfwright/spur/blob/master/test/spur_test.exs). See [this thread](https://elixirforum.com/t/spur-very-simple-activity-streams-for-ecto/22086?u=tfwright) for more information on the idea behind Spur and the changelog.

## Installation

Basic steps are

1. Add Spur to your application `deps`.
2. Tell Spur which Ecto Repo to use:

    ```
    config :spur, repo: MyApp.Repo
    ```

3. Generate and run a migration that adds an "activities" table to your repo (see priv/test/migrations). To use a different table name, set the `activities_table_name` config. To use
   `:uuid` primary key for your activities table, set the `uuid_primary_key_enabled` config to true.


That's enough to start tracking arbitrary activities:

```
%Spur.Activity{actor: "caesar", action: "came", object: "your-county", meta: %{also: ["saw", "conquered"]}}
```

Fields are based on https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#example-1

## Getting fancy

### "Callbacks"

If you want to make use of automatic tracking of inserts, updates and deletes, make sure your objects implement the required fields as functions:

```
defmodule Battle do
  defimpl Spur.Trackable, for: __MODULE__ do
    def actor(war), do: "Accounts.User:#{war.general_id}"
    def object(war), do: "war:#{war.id}"
    def target(_war), do: nil
  end
end
```

Now instead of using `Repo` to perform your operation, use `Spur` instead:

```
%MyApp.Battle{general_id: 5}
|> MyApp.Battle.changeset
|> Spur.insert
```

In this example, a record for both your `Battle` and an `Activity` with action set to insert will be stored in the DB. Of course, the `Battle` fails validations, neither will be inserted and the changeset will be returned with errors, just as `Repo` would. Otherwise it will return the `Battle`. (*Note*: As of 0.3.0, Spur supports the `expose_transactions` config, which when sets to true returns the raw Ecto transaction. Us this if you need to access the created `Activity` struct.)

Each of these callback functions also take a `Map` of properties that will be added to the `Activity` record, or a `Function` that returns a `Map`. You can use this to set or override default Activity data in the callback itself. If, for example, the actor for a given schema is not stored in the Repo, you may want to use the logged in user instead:

```
Spur.insert(changeset, %{actor: conn.assigns.current_user.id})
```

### Audience

To automatically associate the `Activity` with an [audience](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-audience) requires a bit of extra configuration:

1. Add `audience_module` to your app's Spur config: `audience_module: MyApp.Accounts.User`
2. Add a `many_to_many` association between your audience module's Ecto schema. By default Spur expects this to be named `:activities`. If you want to name it something else, add another line to the config: `audience_assoc_name: :events`.
3. Finally, make sure that your trackable objects implement `audience`. It should return either an Ecto query or a plain list of the audience structs configured with the above association.

Now when you use one of the callback's above to track an object, the resulting `Activity` will automatically be associated with the audience records returned for that object:

      # SpurTest.TrackableStruct
      def audience(trackable_struct), do: Ecto.assoc(trackable_struct, :watchers)

      [watcher] = trackable_struct.watchers

      Ecto.Changeset.change(trackable_struct)
      |> Spur.update

      [%Spur.Activity{action: update}] = watcher.activities
